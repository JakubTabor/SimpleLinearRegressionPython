# SimpleLinearRegressionPython
# This is my first simple linearr egression model
# Frist i import my libraries and then i load data and split my columns, save theam as "x" and "y"
# Then i split my dataset into "train" and "test" set change the "test_size" into 0.2 off total, and set "random_state" into 0
# Next i train my LinearRegression model """regressor.fit(x_train, y_train)"""
# I save my prediction into "y_pred" """y_pred = regressor.predict(x_test)"""
